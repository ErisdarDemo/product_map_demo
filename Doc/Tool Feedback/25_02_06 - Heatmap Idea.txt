	What information or utility can be integrated for ProductMap use through heat maps distributed across the ProductMap?

@section 	Coloring

	Improved ProductMap visualization for display
	
	• Background shaded sections (functional / modular / hardware / feature)
	
	• Colored diagram components!
	
	• Consider allowing user customization for the coloring
	
	Call out risks, opens or other highlights for record
	
@section 	Heat Maps

	Types (Development Completion Status, Risk, ...!)

	Where items on the ProductMap are assigned a value, and a 2D heat map is generated
	
	Status reports & development plans can come from this!
