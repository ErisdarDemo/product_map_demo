@section 	Ideas

	• What if ProductMap could produce
		
		- customer: students? serves good visibility
		
		- input: a student project (source code, customer descrip ¶ & list of requirements)
		
		- output: Blog summary post describing their solution (needs->...->solution!)
			
			* Product Map
			
			* Easy Navigation utility through the source!!
				  
		- yielding: clear communication from this customer to their targets of new work & help 
		            sharing their solution

	• Stack Overflow collab? What if ProductMap begins a default plugin anyone can add to help users visualize & discuss their code?

@section 	FW Architects/Engineers

	Three types, I've found - 
	
	1. Passion - Driven by what they do and results they achieve, typically a synergistic blend of architects & engineers
	
		*e.g. Justin & his peers
	
	2. Results - They've been good at what they do, delivering results and are steadfast and resolute. Is their code good? .. It works and they will stand behind it.
	
		*e.g. the FW architects @ Midmark)
	
	3. Success - They target excellence and achieve results, where their continued success over time secures & cements their role 
	
		*e.g. Card Access @ Sub-Zero
		
@section 	Bootloader/SDK Descrip

	Abstract - All I see is interfaces
	
	Complex - Wow, look what's under the hood! Lucky we paid experts (e.g. NXP/ST) to produce it
	
	Established - It works, don't worry about it
