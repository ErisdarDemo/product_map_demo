@section 	Idea

	1) Network! Prepare your pitch to connect with new audiences, and release! Get your colleague's help then expanding that
	
		Toni's connection with Justin
		
		*Justin's connection with Toni?
		
		*Academic prospect
		
			"Look how we can help"
			
			*some UW reach outs
			
	2) Lay roots
	
		e.g. students with succesful capstone projects that use it
		
	3) Let it grow
	
		and help it grow, listen and adapt!
		
		e.g. at student's first job they share for prospect

@section 	Opps!

	Sushree Subhasmita Jena (graduation speech is inspiring!)

@section 	Capstone Descrip

	AI descrip to understand the code exists?
	
	Much more
	
	- Visibility of new design ideas
	
		@ask 	? how ? more requirements?
		
		Giving them full picture visibility that empowers them to connect with the full picture they couldn't see there before that
		
			for example Will there, trying to secure shared resources didn't realize how much concurrency his system required!
		
		@opp	ProductMap elicits recommendations or question to flush out that new design
				(because most of this has already down)
		
	- Exploration of how that would work (exploring the map for what they propose)
	
		Where all the pieces show up! 
		
		And now this visibility allows them to plan, secure & expand!!
		
@section 	Utility Example

	@q where does that come from?
	
		- it comes to life! Starting with your recommendations, and growing through feedback through questions with customer?
		
		- e.g. 101 - ask them what their shared resources are and requirements are, then walk through dependency paths, manually here at first for 101, to expose further depenency

@section 	Heat Map Example!
