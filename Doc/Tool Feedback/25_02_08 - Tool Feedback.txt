	• It would be nice to have the generated maps be grouped and able to be renamed (e.g. seeing five main.c's without description is not useful for me. Can I rename their displayed titles?
	
		*re-ordering & grouping this content would be nice too!
		
		*I have to push refresh to see when a line completes, can this be automatic?

	• A 'Code Snippet' displayed as "{" is confusing
	
	• This graph is way too tall! This is not useful to me in this layout

	• I am concerned with how this tool scales and allows for customization
	
@section 	Followup Notes (2/13)

	• Project url upload tests (for all three versions, upload per SHA?) 
	
	• The ProductMap mobile interface works great! At least for what I test with 
	
	• Mobile generated maps table has columns that can’t be expanded, cutting words off (pushed to #Mobile [1])
