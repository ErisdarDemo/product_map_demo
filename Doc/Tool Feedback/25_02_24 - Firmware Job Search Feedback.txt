@section 	Prompt
	Are these questions/issues valid for a FW engineer while looking for a job?

	- Recruiters overlook your resume because they don’t see your technical depth.

		I think recruiter access now to available skillsets comes through a focused lens that filters out a lot. I had created justinreina.com?embedded to help alleviate though
	
	- Reading through thousands of lines of firmware code slows you down.

		I never do; I leverage tools like IDE navigation and solution explorers to achieve this
		
		IFFFF there was an Eclipse plugin for ProductMap though OMG.
		
	- Hiring managers don’t understand your low-level firmware work.
		
		I haven't had this problem yet, but I have apprehension that I will be able to communicate this effectively
		
	- Not sure what to post online to build your credibility?
		
		PORTFOLIO DEMOS OF GOOD CODE - SHOW SHIT THAT WORKS
		
	- Struggling to have meaningful conversations in tech interviews?
		
		They don't seem to care, sometimes and here - yes
		
		Or like with James at Lazurite last week, we talked for thirty minutes about his experiences with Marvel & NXP off-to-the-side, was great!

	If so, solutions would be (powered by PM):

	- Use AI-powered code maps to highlight your firmware expertise instantly.
	
		YES
	
	- Navigate and understand complex codebases 10x faster with visual feature maps.
	
		YES !!
	
	- Share clear, visual maps that showcase your contributions in an engaging way.
	
		IFF SO, OMG YES
	
	- Generate and share AI-powered insights from your code to stand out in tech communities.
	
		Eclipse Plugin OMG !!! Where you could then AUTOMATICALLY integration to STM32 (CubeIDE), NXP (McuExpresso), TI (CCS up to v12.8), Freescale (CodeWarrior), Python (PyDev!) and .... [1]!

	- Show how you think through code with structured insights from AI.

		Wow, YES I love this. Just like how Google's AI assistant to my Google search queries [2] is changing the way I develop
