@section 	Call

	Engneering & IT Service support for the burgeoning market of embedded IoT

@section 	Opp
	
	Providing a Virtual Lab Tools SAAS environment to 
	
	a) acclimate new customers
	
	b) increase adoption (lowering the risk)
	
	c) leveraging utilities (showing them what can be done & giving them the tools)
	
	d) having some fun (promote collaboration & community building a larger & sustained solution)

	Something like Wind Rivers  Virtual Labs, but more hands-on with a wider audience [1]
	
@section 	Market
	
	Established industry entering IIOT
	
	Common IOT customers
	
	...?

@section 	Tool
	
	1) Server use (MySQL ....! Empowering with access, utility & use)
	
	2) On-site DAQ test instrumentation (NI USB-DAQ for AIO/DIO/SWITCH/COMMSN, NI Compact-RIO for FPGA & NI PXI for more! To start, I have gotten donations from NI before to start initiatives like this)
	
	3) Platform integration (Say you want to get started with say, a Renasas MCU or Cypress PSoC but can't afford the uncertainties to commit? No problem - use our SAAS to integrate & acclimate with many platforms to securely get up to speed)
	
	4) HIL/SIL testing - YES, providing instrumentation, example & support to achieve your needs
	
	5) Documentation - With like a ProductMap [2] or Driver AI [3]
	
	6) Hardware Management
	
	7) Hardware Simulation
