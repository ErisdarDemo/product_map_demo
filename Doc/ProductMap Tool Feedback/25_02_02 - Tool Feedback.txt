	• When I logged back in today the tool didn't recognize me? Where is the status & user info?

		*Maybe I had cleared my cache & browser; not sure
	
	• This drag-n-drop feature is really nice, and I appreciate the file info displayed after loaded

	• I like the 'Generated Maps' page, this is nice!
	
		*Would be interesting to have a pop-up of the map from the list item

	• Would be nice to be able to select which items are displayed in the tool
	
		*And color coding would be very useful here too!
		
	• I like how scroll doesn't require a hotkey; I appreciate that
	
	• Now that I am using for a hardware application, I would like more ability to customize layout, coloring and visible components
	
	• Where your display descriptions are great!! e.g. "Initialize HAL". but I feel a disconnect of ownership without being able to edit
	
	• Typedefs just show up at 'typedef ...' ?

	• The scroll view for SystemClock_Config() has a lot of content! 

	• When looking at my Generated maps listing it would be nice for me to be able to customize each items naming or label (e.g. with all my demos just listed each as 'main.c' gets confusing)
	
	• Window for ProductMap has max limitations!! (e.g I tried to rotate my monitor to Portrait for a screen shot of the FreeRTOS map but the window was now capped)
