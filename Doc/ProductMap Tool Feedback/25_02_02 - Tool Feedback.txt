	• When I logged back in today the tool didn't recognize me? Where is the status & user info?

		*Maybe I had cleared my cache & browser; not sure
	
	• This drag-n-drop feature is really nice, and I appreciate the file info displayed after loaded

	• I like the 'Generated Maps' page, this is nice!
	
		*Would be interesting to have a pop-up of the map from the list item

	• Would be nice to be able to select which items are displayed in the tool
	
		*And color coding would be very useful here too!
		
	• I like how scroll doesn't require a hotkey; I appreciate that
	
	• Now that I am using for a hardware application, I would like more ability to customize layout, coloring and visible components
	
	• Where your display descriptions are great!! e.g. "Initialize HAL". but I feel a disconnect of ownership without being able to edit
	
	• Typedefs just show up at 'typedef ...' ?

	• The scroll view for SystemClock_Config() has a lot of content!
