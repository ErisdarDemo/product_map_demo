@section 	Improvements

	• Header Bar Navigation

		- 'Lines of Code | nnn' navigates to the code open in a seperate tab with syntax highlighting (and maybe even tool navigation!)
		
		- 'file.cpp' navigates to the source with syntax highlighting in a pop-up
		
		- 'Main Feature | nnn' navigates to some UML summary the user can link to (IF THEY WABT!)
		
		- 'Feature Level mmm | nnn' navigates to ?
			
		- 'Code Functions | nnn' navigates to ?
		
		- 'Code SNuppets | nnn' navigates to ?
			
	• Or for any of the header bar listings <expand>
	
	• In the 'Product Map' view if I select 'Examples' the back key afterwards does not return to the Product Map as I would expect!
	
	• How do I download Heart.cpp?
	
	• I LOVE, the export feature. Could this provide format options like CSV or maybe Xlsx?
	
	• Let's build an interface and access to code repos & wikis in, maybe streamlined to GitHub/GitLab??
	
	• What about repo/wiki interfacing & overlap with this tool? Just a thought
	
		- 'External Wiki' feat of GitLab? [2]
