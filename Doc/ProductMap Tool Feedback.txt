@section 	Improvements

	• When I login it goes to the advertising page! I would expect navigation to an entry Control Panel or Navigation Pane for creation and review of ProductMaps
	
	• "Upload or drag and drop a single source code file (maximum: 5 MB size and 15,000 lines of code)."
	
		- Can this be a '+' button the left for selection, with that summary string printed in text offset to the right of this '+' button?
		
			* Drag-n-drop onto this was nice though!! UI is very clean here
			
			* I would hope to see '.', '..', '...' processing dots cycling here for 3-5 seconds, indicating you are processing the results. Also consider notification update to this screen, if the user is still waiting here and it completes! That would be a great user experience
	
	• If would be nice to show the feature blocks source summary on your map! e.g. for my 'base' demo
	
		- "Run demo tasks"
		
		- "Execute Tasks"
		
		- "Execute PMU Task"
		
		...
		
		* Differing capitalization here on "tasks" is distracting and confusing
		
		* Loving this
		
	• Code summaries in sub-windows don't handle long lines (e.g. inline comments) well & wrap!
	
		- Mouse scrolling on code window would be nice too
	
	• The expand and collapse animations on the graph are great
	
	• This tool needs Syntax highlighting! 
	
		- Common source syntax highlighting
		
		- And more clear block coloring (e.g. Feature block is light purple shade & Function block is ligh brown shade)
		
		- And maybe section background shading too!

	• Location identification for Features!
	
		- e.g. on entry I thought features were actually code functions, and didn't even expand that for ten minues
		
		- e.g. for my 'Execute Data Task' a bottom right label of "main() calls data_task()" or something
			
	• Consider having the a pane on the left half of window expose the syntax highlighted source code (e.g. main.c here for my demos)
	
		* e.g. for me here, this map was not useful unless I had the IDE open on my other monitor for review
	
		* Which may initially be open to half of the screen, for a few seconds and then minimizes. And can be expanded or minimized with a simple & clear arrow button on the left side of window
		
		* And consider mapping source to the map here visually with hover overs!!1
	
	• 'Share' works great!

	• 'Export' feels like it needs options! Got me excited though
	
		- I was expecting 'Export' to have page 1 of the PDF display the actual zoomed out ProductMap! Is this posible? Where do you configure the export?
		
		- What if 'Export' allows selection of media type (PDF/PNG/...) and config (e.g. p.1. as Map?)
	
	• I had no idea how to edit the meta sub-panel information for tasks or rename them
	
	• This tool has smooth access & scroll
		
	• Header Bar Navigation

		- 'Lines of Code | nnn' navigates to the code open in a seperate tab with syntax highlighting (and maybe even tool navigation!)
		
		- 'file.cpp' navigates to the source with syntax highlighting in a pop-up
		
		- 'Main Feature | nnn' navigates to some UML summary the user can link to (IF THEY WABT!)
		
		- 'Feature Level mmm | nnn' navigates to ?
			
		- 'Code Functions | nnn' navigates to ?
		
		- 'Code SNuppets | nnn' navigates to ?
			
	• Or for any of the header bar listings <expand>
	
	• In the 'Product Map' view if I select 'Examples' the back key afterwards does not return to the Product Map as I would expect!
	
	• How do I download Heart.cpp?
	
	• I LOVE, the export feature. Could this provide format options like CSV or maybe Xlsx?
	
	• Let's build an interface and access to code repos & wikis in, maybe streamlined to GitHub/GitLab??
	
	• What about repo/wiki interfacing & overlap with this tool? Just a thought
	
		- 'External Wiki' feat of GitLab? [2]
